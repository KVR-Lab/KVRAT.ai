\# KVR Monorepo Structure



Version: 2.0



Status: Architecture Baseline



Authority:

KVR Architecture Governance



Scope:

KVR Platform Repository Structure



\---



\# Purpose



This document defines the official repository structure of the KVR Platform.



The monorepo architecture organizes applications, core capabilities, shared packages, infrastructure, and documentation into clear boundaries.



The structure is designed to support scalability, maintainability, and independent evolution.



\---



\# Monorepo Position



KVR uses a modular monorepo architecture.

\# Applications Layer



Location:



```text

apps/

```



Purpose:



Contains product applications built on top of KVR-Core.



Examples:



```text

apps/backend



apps/web



apps/mobile



apps/admin

```



Rules:



Applications contain:



\* Product logic

\* User experiences

\* Business workflows



Applications do not modify KVR-Core responsibilities.



\---



\# Core Platform Layer



Location:



```text

packages/kvr

```



Purpose:



Contains the KVR-Core engineering platform.



Responsibilities:



\* Kernel

\* Runtime

\* AI Foundation

\* Agent Platform

\* Generation Pipeline

\* Core Services



Rules:



KVR-Core must remain reusable across applications.



\---



\# Shared Packages



Location:



```text

packages/

```



Purpose:



Contains reusable libraries.



Examples:



\* UI components

\* Shared types

\* Configuration

\* Utilities



Rules:



Shared packages must not contain application-specific logic.



\---



\# Infrastructure Layer



Location:



```text

infrastructure/

```



Purpose:



Contains deployment and operational resources.



Examples:



\* Docker

\* Database configuration

\* Cloud deployment

\* Monitoring



\---



\# Documentation Layer



Location:



```text

docs/

```



Purpose:



Contains official project knowledge.



Documentation is the source of truth for:



\* Architecture

\* Decisions

\* Standards

\* Operations



\---



\# Tools Layer



Location:



```text

tools/

```



Purpose:



Contains developer automation tools.



Examples:



\* Scripts

\* Generators

\* Validation tools

\* Maintenance utilities



\---



\# Dependency Rules



Allowed direction:



```text

Applications



↓



Shared Packages



↓



KVR-Core



↓



Infrastructure

```



Restrictions:



Applications must not create hidden dependencies.



Core must not depend on applications.



Shared packages must remain generic.



\---



\# Development Rules



Every package must define:



\* Purpose

\* Ownership

\* Dependencies

\* Documentation

\* Versioning strategy



\---



\# Build Strategy



The monorepo supports:



\* Independent package builds

\* Application builds

\* Shared dependency management

\* Automated validation



\---



\# Evolution Strategy



The monorepo may evolve to support:



\* Independent deployment

\* Plugin ecosystem

\* Distributed services

\* Multiple products



All changes require architecture review.
